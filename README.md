Loan Default Prediction using Machine Learning Project

Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of a loan default. It involves building and evaluating machine learning models to determine which model performs the best at predicting loan defaults. The goal of this project is to help lenders identify which borrowers are most likely to default on their loans and to reduce financial risk.

Data
The data used for this project is a publicly available dataset that includes information on borrowers' credit scores, income, loan amount, loan term, and other related attributes.

Technologies Used
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
AWS

Steps Involved
1. Data Preprocessing:
Involves cleaning the data, transforming the data, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
Analyzes the data to identify trends, patterns, and relationships between variables.

3. Feature Selection:
Selects the most relevant features that contribute the most to the prediction of loan defaults.

4. Model Building:
Builds and evaluates several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

5. Model Evaluation:
Compares the performance of the different models using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve.

6. Hyperparameter Tuning:
Fine-tunes the parameters of the best performing model to optimize its performance.

7. Model Deployment:
Deploys the trained machine learning model to predict the likelihood of loan defaults.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate machine learning models to predict loan defaults. By following the steps outlined in this project, one can gain insights into which borrowers are most likely to default on their loans and reduce financial risk. The project also provides a foundation for exploring other related problems in the finance industry, such as credit risk assessment and fraud detection.
